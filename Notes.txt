1) keep 2 folders for the NN models trigger_models and target_models
2) for each model lets have a seperate layers file to make the updates orthhogonal.
3) epoch.py will be depreciated we will have all trigger training methods in dynamic_triggers.py; first we implement vanilla method then input-ware

4) for the model parametters we can have json files.
